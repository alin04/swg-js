# SwG Login Prompt flow (NOT YET LAUNCHED)

This is the flow in which Google will ask the user for permission to log them in to the publisher's site. It is initiated by the publisher when the publisher doesn't find a user's subscription but Google does find the subscription.


There are two ways to implement this flow:


1. Wait message (left), then notify the user they're being logged in (right).

2. Wait message (left), then prompt the user to log in (right).

The publisher is responsible for deciding if they want to notify the user that they're being logged in (first flow) or prompt the user to login (second flow). 


Here is an example of what this flow can look like:

```
// You, the Publisher, go to look up the user. Resolve the promise with an account (if it was found).
const  accountPromise = new Promise( â€¦ ); 

// We notify the user that their account is being looked up.
subscriptions.waitForSubscriptionLookup(accountPromise).then(account => {
    
    // Account was found.
    if(account) {

        // Option 1 - let the user read. 
        // Publisher shows content.
        

        // Option 2 - notify the user that they're being logged in with Google.
        subscriptions.loginNotification().then(response => {
            // Publisher shows content.
        }

        // Option 3 - get user permission to login with Google.
        subscriptions.showLoginPrompt().then(response => {

            // User clicked 'Yes'.
            // Publisher shows content so they can read.

        }, reason => {

            // Publisher can decide how to handle the following situations:

            // User clicked 'No' they are not logged in.
            if(response == 'no') someHandlerForThisSituation();

            // Error.
            if(response == 'error') someHandlerForThisOtherSituation();

        });

  } else {

    // Account was not found. Let's create a new one.
    // Go to docs/deferred-account-flow.md for full documentation.
    subscriptions.completeDeferredAccountCreation({entitlements});

  }
});
```
